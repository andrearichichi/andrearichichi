👨‍💻 Hey there! I'm currently on an adventure as an ML intern at the Bruno Kessler Foundation, while also surfing through the waves of my third year in Computer Science at Trento.


🔥 My passion for diving into new challenges keeps me on my toes, always eager to learn about the latest trends. I love rolling up my sleeves and getting my hands dirty with personal projects, where I can tinker and boost my skills.
