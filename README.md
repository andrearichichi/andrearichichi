👨‍💻 Hey there! I’m currently pursuing my Master’s in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Trento, after completing my Bachelor’s in Computer Science. My journey includes an enriching internship at the Bruno Kessler Foundation, where I deepened my expertise in Machine Learning and video analysis.

🔥 Passionate about embracing new challenges, I stay on the lookout for cutting-edge trends in AI. Whether working on my startup *LavorAI*, enhancing *VolleyVisionAI*, or exploring personal projects, I love getting hands-on and pushing the boundaries of my skills.
