Hi, I’m Andrea Richichi, currently pursuing a Master’s in Artificial Intelligence Systems at the University of Trento and soon heading to Norway for an Erasmus at NTNU. I love turning complex AI concepts into real, impactful solutions.

At the Bruno Kessler Foundation, I worked on VolleyVisionAI, a computer vision tool that tracks ball trajectories and players to help coaches improve game strategies. Recently, I’ve been part of LavorAI, a startup focused on digital innovation in construction, we even secured €500K in funding (yes, that was a big win!).

Always curious, always building. If it involves Machine Learning, Computer Vision, or creative problem-solving, count me in.
